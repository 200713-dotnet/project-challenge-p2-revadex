## project

StarDex is a web application that allows users to view a map of the stars that are visible from Earth and navigate through them for information. They are organized by groups in space, and as you click on a group, a more “zoomed in” image is displayed, where you can individually view details on stars, constellations and planets. As a user, you can click on groups and view the information on each item. This application brings a wealth of the information about space in the form of an attractive and easy to navigate UI.
